## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

1. Programmed the detailed age function
1. Created the basic HTML for UI components
1. Analysed element dimensions in Figma
1. Styled the UI (mobile first)
1. Added media queries for the desktop breakpoint
1. Programmed validation functions
1. Programmed the 'count-up' number animation
1. Refactored and split functions into util files

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- [DOM Constraint API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState#browser_compatibility) - Field validation

### What I learned

#### CSS

1. Fluid font sizing can be achieved using the [`clamp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) function and flexbox:

```scss
.age {
  padding-top: 8rem;
  font-size: clamp($size-input, 6.4rem, 14vw);
  font-weight: 800;
  font-style: italic;
  line-height: 7rem;
  @include desktop {
    padding-top: 6rem;
    font-size: 10.5rem;
    line-height: 12rem;
  }

  &__data {
    display: flex;
    gap: 1rem;
  }

  &__unit {
    flex-shrink: 1;
  }
}
```

2. An element can be accurately positioned using `position` and `transform: translate(x% , y%)`. Using `translate` with percentage values moves the element based on its own dimensions.

#### React

1. **`useRef`** is not only used for getting a value but for accessing DOM properties of a referenced node. This was useful for field validation. Other than that, its great for getting a value without changing states.

1. **`onBlur`** is React's equivalent of JavaScripts `onFocusOut` event.

1. State update functions can be passed into exported functions as callbacks. It is then executed in the function body.

#### TypeScript for React

- `React.SyntheticEvent` is used to define an event type when adding an event listener. Other forms of event types are:
  - `KeyboardEvent`: For key presses
  - `FormEvent`: For use with `onInput`

#### JavaScript

- Timers (`setInterval` and `setTimeout`) need to be assigned to a variable. Else, there's no way to reference them when calling `clearInterval`/ `clearTimeout`.

- **Modulo operator:** dividing a value by 0 returns `NaN`.

  In the _count up_ function _(animation utils)_, if targetVal was divided by 0, the result will be `NaN` creating a bug which causes the setInterval function to loop infinately. To fix this, we use the ternary operator to define the values per case:

  ```javascript
  const remainder = steps > 0 ? targetVal % steps : 0;
  ```

- **`e.preventDefault`** isn't only used for preventing form submission or hyperlinks. Additionally, it can be used to prevent certain letters from being entered in a form.

  The 'e' _(Eulers number)_, '+' and '-' values are used to represent numbers. However, 'e' or 'E' sets the `badInput` validation value to `true`, triggering the field's invalid state.

  On top of validating against bad inputs, it improves the user experience to prevent these characters from being entered.
